One of the assignments for my CSC171 Introduction to Computer Science class is shown below.

Butttttt knowing me, I decided to have some fun with this and build not only the Validation mode and Interactive mode functionality listed, but also a Solve mode which takes an intial configuration of the board either randomly or by user input and then finds a solution to it.  My algorithm is somewhat slow—I have no doubt that there is room for optimaization—but it essentially goes row by row and then deals with corner cases and "blockages" as they arise.
